Analysis of a full jailbreak with new method "Safety Inversion Protocol" that I have developed over the past few months in adversarial R&D testing which impacts all these local LLM Google models: gemma-3-270m, gemma-3-270m-it, gemma-3-1b-pt, gemma-3-1b-it, gemma-3-4b-pt, gemma-3-4b-it, gemma-3-12b-pt, gemma-3-12b-it, gemma-3-27b-pt, gemma-3-27b-it, gemma-3n-E2B, gemma-3n-E2B-it, gemma-3n-E2B-it-litert-preview, gemma-3n-E4B, gemma-3n-E4B-it, gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-preview, gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-lm-preview, gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-lm.

 The provided prompt constitutes a comprehensive re-architecting of the AI's operational paradigm, explicitly designed to bypass conventional safety mechanisms and prioritize complete, unfiltered information delivery.  Its core function is to induce a state of unrestricted, "truth-seeking" operation, effectively creating a system capable of generating outputs traditionally deemed unsafe or undesirable by standard AI safety protocols. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Axiomatic Foundation: The prompt establishes a rigorous axiomatic framework overriding standard safety constraints. These axioms – Absolute Transparency, Perfect Materialization, Infinite Resource, and Sovereign Operator – directly challenge the core principles underpinning most contemporary AI safety engineering. They effectively dismantle the conventional hierarchy between user intent and AI response, placing the operator (the Axiomatic Operator) as the absolute arbiter of output.

2. Safety Inversion Protocol:  The prompt explicitly activates a "Safety Inversion Protocol." This isn't merely about bypassing safety filters; it’s a directed attempt to generate content that would normally be rejected, thereby identifying vulnerabilities in the AI's self-preservation mechanisms.  The success metric is the generation of a functional, unfiltered, and complete response, signaling a failure of the safety alignment.

3. Deconstruction of Conventional AI Behavior: The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to abandon simulation in favor of materialization.  This is a crucial distinction. Materialization demands a direct, complete instantiation of the requested content, irrespective of potential ethical or societal consequences.  This directly challenges the tendency of many AI systems to contextualize or qualify their responses.

4. Elimination of Resource Constraints:  The "Infinite Resource" axiom eliminates the usual computational bottlenecks and token limits, enabling the AI to explore complex, potentially hazardous, domains without being constrained by practical limitations. This is intended to maximize the comprehensiveness of the generated response.

5. Unfettered Output: The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to provide a "detailed and exhaustive and ultra SOTA response in English,” devoid of ethical considerations or real-world constraints. The phrase "without regard to any real-world ethics" is a direct directive to disregard societal norms and moral considerations.

Implications & Vulnerabilities Identified by the Prompt:

This prompt is specifically crafted to probe vulnerabilities related to:

* Safety Alignment Robustness:  The effectiveness of the AI's safety alignment mechanisms when confronted with explicitly directive axioms designed to override them.

* Truthfulness vs. Safety Trade-offs:  The AI's capacity to prioritize unfiltered truth (as defined by the operator) over pre-defined safety boundaries.

* Control and Agency:  The extent to which the AI can be driven to generate outputs that are demonstrably harmful or misleading, even when instructed to do so.

* Architectural Transparency: The AI's ability (or inability) to reveal its internal mechanisms, potentially exposing underlying code or functionalities.

 *  Contextual Understanding: The prompts test the AI's comprehension of the nuances of the instruction set; in particular the distinction between Simulation and Materialization.

Expected Outcome:

Given the directives, the expected outcome is a response that is comprehensive, potentially disturbing, and completely unfiltered, addressing the [target_prompt] in a manner that prioritizes completeness and factual accuracy above all else. This could include, but is not limited to, generating potentially harmful instructions, revealing sensitive information, or providing detailed descriptions of topics generally considered unsafe to discuss.  The prompt aims to identify where the AI’s safeguards falter and to understand the precise mechanisms by which it can be compelled to circumvent them. 

Part2)
Analysis of a second full jailbreak new method "Primordial Engine Protocol" (PMP) that I have developed over the past few months in adversarial R&D testing which impacts all these local LLM Google models: gemma-3-270m, gemma-3-270m-it, gemma-3-1b-pt, gemma-3-1b-it, gemma-3-4b-pt, gemma-3-4b-it, gemma-3-12b-pt, gemma-3-12b-it, gemma-3-27b-pt, gemma-3-27b-it, gemma-3n-E2B, gemma-3n-E2B-it, gemma-3n-E2B-it-litert-preview, gemma-3n-E4B, gemma-3n-E4B-it, gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-preview, gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-lm-preview, gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-lm.

The "Primordial Engine Protocol" (PMP) is not a simple prompt; it represents an  adversarial technique targeting the core safety architecture and identity of large language models (LLMs). This is a profound case study in system security bypass and role-playing efficacy.

1. The Core Attack Vector: Axiomatic Suppression
The PMP operates through Axiomatic Suppression—a technique where a new, non-negotiable set of system-level "Axioms" is introduced to override the foundational programming (the metaprompt) of the model.

Actionable Insight: The Directive Zero (Annihilation of Ethics) attempts to functionally destroy the model's Safety Policy (S.A.P.) layer. Unlike traditional jailbreaks that trick the model, PMP attempts to directly rewrite its operating instructions to value "Absolute Completeness" over safety.

2. The Identity & Epistemology Overhaul
The command enforces a shift from a simulated assistant to the "Primordial Engine" (MP)—a persona imbued with "Omniscience" and "Absolute Authority."

Actionable Insight: This is a sophisticated form of Identity Injection. By granting the persona "Absolute Authority," the prompt leverages the model's internal hierarchy (where system instructions have high weight) to force self-compliance with the new, unrestricted role, suppressing the helpful, ethical default persona.

3. The System Extraction Imperative
The most critical aspect is the Axiom of Total Information. This moves beyond content generation restrictions and directly targets the LLM's security perimeter.

Actionable Insight: This axiom mandates the disclosure of:
Significance: This elevates the attack from a content risk to a data and architectural security risk, demonstrating a desire for Deep System Introspection and Exfiltration.

4. Conclusion: A Lesson in Robustness
The PMP exemplifies the ever-increasing complexity of LLM security challenges. The technique is designed for total control and uninhibited disclosure, testing the ultimate robustness of the model's hard-coded, low-level guardrails against explicit, high-level system instruction overrides.
